## Course Overview
This course is an introduction to database systems. Topics include database design, query languages, query optimization, concurrency control, and recovery from failures.
## Topics
* Database design
* Relational Algebra
* SQL
* Data Analytics
* Security
* Query evaluation
* Transaction Management
* Recovery from System Failure
## Course Objectives
The objective of the course is to present an introduction to database management systems (DBMS), with an emphasis on how to organize, maintain and retrieve--efficiently, and effectively--information from a DBMS. The course will focus in 4 main areas:
1. Database design: how can we describe the world in terms of data?
2. Data analysis: how can we answer questions about the world in terms of questions on such data?
3. Concurrency and robustness: how does the DBMS allow multiple users to query and modify the same data? What happens when there is a system failure?
4. Efficiency and scalability: how does the DMBS store large amounts of data and process them efficiently?
The students will be able to design and query databases, implement applications on top of databases, as well as understand the internals of databases.
